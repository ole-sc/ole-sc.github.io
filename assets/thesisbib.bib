  abstract = {Glacial--interglacial cycles are global climatic changes which have characterized the last 3 million years. The eight latest glacial--interglacial cycles represent changes in sea level over 100~m, and their average duration was around 100,000 years. There is a long tradition of modelling glacial--interglacialcycles with low-order dynamical systems. In some of these models, the cyclic phenomenon is caused by non-linear interactions between components of the climate system, which generate a limit cycle. Other models incorporate the established Milankovitch theory according to which changes in Earth's orbit and obliquity force variations in ice volume and ice sheet extent along with, either directly or indirectly, variations in other variables of the climate system. One then distinguishes the strong interpretation, in which the astronomical forcing is necessary to generate glacial--interglacial cycles, from the weak interpretation, in which the astronomical forcing synchronizes a limit cycle. The purpose of the present contribution is to consider specifically the effects of stochastic forcings. Indeed, the trajectories obtained in presence of stochastic fluctuations are not necessarily noised-up versions of the deterministic trajectories. They may follow pathways which have no analogue in the deterministic version of the model. Our purpose is to demonstrate the mechanisms by which stochastic excitation may generate such large-scale oscillations, sometimes with an intermittent character. To this end, we consider a series of models previously introduced in the literature, starting with autonomous models with two variables, and then three variables. The properties of stochastic trajectories are understood by reference to the bifurcation diagrams, the vector field, and a method called stochastic sensitivity analysis. We then introduce models accounting for the Milankovitch forcing, and distinguish forced and synchronized ice-age scenarios. We show again how noise may generate trajectories which have no immediate analogue in the deterministic model. We conclude on a general reflection on the interest of this research and its potential applications on a wide range of climatic phenomena.},

As an example, we consider how contemporary climate variability induces tipping from a predator--prey cycle to extinction in two paradigmatic predator--prey models with an Allee effect. Our analysis of these examples uncovers a counterintuitive behaviour, which we call phase tipping or P-tipping, where tipping to extinction occurs only from certain phases of the cycle. To explain this behaviour, we combine global dynamics with set theory and introduce the concept of partial basin instability for attracting limit cycles. This concept provides a general framework to analyse and identify easily testable criteria for the occurrence of phase tipping in externally forced systems, and can be extended to more complicated attractors.},

For a specific model system with a parameter shift between two asymptotically autonomous systems with periodic attractors, we characterise thresholds of rate-induced tipping to partial and total tipping.

The changing mean has received considerable attention from scientists and climate policy makers. However, recent work indicates that the changing variability, that is, the amplitude and the temporal autocorrelation of deviations from the mean, may have greater and more imminent impact on ecosystems. In this paper, we demonstrate that changes in climate variability alone could drive cyclic predator--prey ecosystems to extinction via so-called phase-tipping (P-tipping), a new type of instability that occurs only from certain phases of the predator--prey cycle. We construct a mathematical model of a variable climate and couple it to two self-oscillating paradigmatic predator--prey models. Most importantly, we combine realistic parameter values for the Canada lynx and snowshoe hare with actual climate data from the boreal forest. In this way, we demonstrate that critically important species in the boreal forest have increased likelihood of P-tipping to extinction under predicted changes in climate variability, and are most vulnerable during stages of the cycle when the predator population is near its maximum. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that stochastic resonance is the underlying mechanism for the increased likelihood of P-tipping to extinction.},

  abstract = {Periodic environmental variability is a common source affecting ecosystems and regulating their dynamics. This paper investigates the effects of periodic variation in species growth rate on the population dynamics of three bistable ecological systems. The first is a one-dimensional insect population model with coexisting outbreak and refuge equilibrium states, the second one describes two-species predator--prey interactions with extinction and coexistence states, and the third one is a three-species food chain model where chaotic and limit cycle states may coexist. We demonstrate with numerical simulations that a periodic variation in species growth rate may cause switching between two coexisting attractors without crossing any bifurcation point. Such a switchover occurs only for a specific initial population density close to the basin boundary, leading to partial tipping if the frozen system is non-chaotic. Partial tipping may also occur for some initial points far from the basin boundary if the frozen system is chaotic. Interestingly, the probability of tipping shows a frequency response with a maximum for a specific frequency of periodic forcing, as noticed for equilibrium and non-equilibrium limit cycle systems. The findings suggest that unexpected outbreaks or abrupt declines in population density may occur due to time-dependent variations in species growth parameters. Depending on the selective frequency of the periodic environmental variation, this may lead to species extinction or help the species to survive.},

As a response, tipping phenomena, i.e., abrupt qualitative changes in the dynamics of ecosystems, like transitions between alternative stable states, can be observed. We study such critical transitions, caused by an interplay between B-tipping, the rate of change of environmental forcing, and a rate-dependent basin boundary crossing. Instead of a slow trend of environmental change, we focus on pulses of variation in the carrying capacity in a simple ecological model, the spruce budworm model, and show how one pulse of environmental change can lead to tracking the current stable state or to tipping to an alternative state depending on the strength and the duration of the pulse. Moreover, we demonstrate that applying a second pulse after the first one, which can track the desired state, can lead to tipping, although its rate is slow and does not even cross the critical threshold. We explain this unexpected behavior in terms of the interacting timescales, the intrinsic ecological timescale, the rate of environmental change, and the movement of the basin boundaries separating the basins of attraction of the two alternative states.}

Research has suggested that certain environmental signatures may play a crucial role in the maintenance of biodiversity and the stability of food webs, while others argue that coupled oscillators ought to promote chaos. As such, numerous uncertainties remain regarding the intersection of temporal environmental patterns and biological responses, and we lack a general understanding of the implications for food web stability. Alarmingly, global change is altering the nature of both environmental rhythms and biological rates. Here, we develop a general theory for how continuous periodic variation in productivity, across temporal scales, influences the stability of consumer--resource interactions: a fundamental building block of food webs. Our results suggest that consumer--resource dynamics under environmental forcing are highly complex and depend on asymmetries in both the speed of forcing relative to underlying dynamics and in local stability properties. These asymmetries allow for environmentally driven stabilization under fast forcing, relative to underlying dynamics, as well as extremely complex and unstable dynamics at slower periodicities. Our results also suggest that changes in naturally occurring periodicities from climate change may lead to precipitous shifts in dynamics and stability.},

We take the intrinsic growth rate of the consumer as our key parameter, allowing it to vary with environmental conditions in ways consistent with the predictions of global warming. We find that the discrete-time system does admit P-tipping, and that the discrete-time P-tipping phenomenon shares characteristics with the continuous-time one: Both require an Allee effect on the resource population, occur in small subsets of the phase plane, and exhibit stochastic resonance as a function of the autocorrelation in the environmental variability. In contrast, the discrete-time P-tipping phenomenon occurs when the environmental conditions switch from low to high productivity, can occur even if the magnitude of the switch is relatively small, and can occur from multiple disjoint regions in the phase plane.},

Based on the example of a paradigmatic low-dimensional dissipative system subjected to different scenarios of parameter drifts of non-negligible rates, we show that a number of novel types of tippings can be observed due to the topological complexity underlying general systems. Tippings from and into several coexisting attractors are possible, and one can find fractality-induced tipping, the consequence of the fractality of the scenario-dependent basins of attractions, as well as tipping into a chaotic attractor. Tipping from or through an extended chaotic attractor might lead to random tipping into coexisting regular attractors, and rate-induced tippings appear not abruptly as phase transitions, rather they show up gradually when the rate of the parameter drift is increased. Since chaotic~systems of arbitrary time-dependence call for ensemble methods, we argue for a probabilistic approach and propose the use of tipping probabilities as a measure of tipping. We numerically determine these quantities and their parameter dependence for all tipping forms discussed.},

While most studies on climate warming focus on the `magnitude of change' of the Earth's temperature, the `rate' at which it is increasing cannot be ruled out. Rapid warming has already caused sudden ecosystem transitions at numerous biodiversity hot spots; a mechanistic understanding of such transitions is crucial. Here, we study a slow--fast consumer--resource ecosystem interacting in rapid warming scenarios. Employing geometric singular perturbation theory, we find that while a gradual change in mean temperature may accord population persistence, a critical warming rate can drive the resource's sudden collapse, termed a warming-induced abrupt transition. This further triggers the bottom-up effect, resulting in the extinction of the consumer. The difference between the optimum temperature of the resource's growth rate and the habitat temperature is crucial in deciding the critical rate of warming. Consequently, species inhabiting extreme temperature regions are more susceptible to warming-induced collapse than those within intermediate temperature ranges. We find that stochastic fluctuations in the system can advance warming-induced transitions, and the efficacy of generic early warning signals to anticipate sudden transitions is challenged.},

  abstract = {We study rate-induced phase-tipping (RP-tipping) between two stable limit cycles of a birhythmic oscillator. We say that such an oscillator RP-tips when a time variation of an input parameter preserves the bistability of the limit cycles but induces transitions from one stable limit cycle to the other, causing abrupt changes in the amplitude and frequency of the oscillations. Crucially, these transitions occur when: the rate of change of the input is in a certain interval bounded by critical rate(s), and the system is in certain phases of the cycle. We focus on two illustrative examples: the birhythmic van der Pol oscillator and the birhythmic Decroly--Goldbeter glycolysis model, each subjected to monotone and non-monotone shifts in their input parameters. We explain RP-tipping in terms of properties of the autonomous frozen system, including the phase of a cycle and partial basin instability along the parameter path traced by the changing input. We show that RP-tipping can occur as an irreversible one-way transition or as a series of transitions between the stable limit cycles. Finally, we present RP-tipping diagrams showing combinations of the rate and magnitude of parameter shifts and the phases of the oscillation that give rise to this genuine non-autonomous instability.},

The main focus of the paper is to get rigorous criteria guaranteeing tracking (i.e. connection between the attractors of the past and the future) or tipping (absence of connection) for the particular case of equations , where {$\Gamma$} is asymptotically constant.

In a constant environment, for the single-patch model we show the existence of degenerate Bogdanov--Takens bifurcation with codimension up to 4 and degenerate Hopf bifurcation with codimension up to 3, which indicate that the nilpotent cusp of codimension 4 is the organizing center of the bifurcation set. Our results show that Allee effects in predators can not only induce much more complex bifurcations and dynamics (such as three limit cycles, multitype tristability), but also serve as a destabilizing factor to make predators extinction (deterministically) when the environment is sufficiently enriched, which provides strong support for the so-called ``paradox of enrichment''. For the two-patch model, we numerically reveal the existence of eight positive steady states including two new coexisting attractors, which means that population dispersal can help species coexist or increase the population abundance. In a changing environment, for the single-patch model we find that the population can track unstable states, fast positive or slow negative environmental change can be beneficial to predators by delaying or even avoiding extinction; while for the two-patch model we observe some interesting phenomena: fast negative (or slow positive) environmental change can make predators in different patches trend to extinction synchronously, and rate-induced different regime shifts.},

For instance, many synchronization patterns result from the underlying network symmetries, and high symmetries are known to increase the stability of synchronization. Yet here we find that general macroscopic features of network solutions such as regularity can be induced by breaking their symmetry of interactions. We demonstrate this effect in an ecological multilayer network where the topological asymmetries occur naturally. These asymmetries rescue the system from chaotic oscillations by establishing stable periodic orbits and equilibria. We call this phenomenon asymmetry-induced order and uncover its mechanism by analyzing both analytically and numerically the absence of dynamics on the system's synchronization manifold. Moreover, the bifurcation scenario describing the route from chaos to order is also disclosed. We demonstrate that this result also holds for generic node dynamics by analyzing coupled paradigmatic R{\"o}ssler and Lorenz systems.},

In this article, we investigate the regime shift phenomena in a Rosenzweig--MacArthur predator--prey model when a strong Allee effect is present in the prey population. Apart from strong Allee effect, we incorporate the time scale disparity between the prey and predator populations. We investigate both single-patch and two-patch models with and without dispersal delay. Our findings indicate that the Allee threshold has a negative impact on species persistence and that species extinction occurs through a regime shift due a to non-local bifurcation. This regime shift through a boundary crisis of a limit-cycle oscillator is fatal from the ecological point of view as it leads to sudden extinction. Our investigation also explores how time scale differences affect the tipping point of the regime shift event and we find that it makes species less resilient. Furthermore, we demonstrate that species dispersal in a two-patch model increases resilience and can rescue populations from extinction when a single isolated patch's species become extinct due to a regime shift. Finally, we show that a time delay in dispersal can further enhance resistance to regime shift by large extent. The occurence of a regime shift through a boundary crisis of an oscillatory attractor has not been extensively investigated previously within the context of a two-species predator--prey model. In this study, we offer a comprehensive bifurcation analysis that delves into how species resilience can be enhanced through the effects of dispersal and time lag in dispersal. We quantify species resilience by employing basin stability metric.},

  abstract = {Over the last 2 decades, tipping points in open systems subject to changing external conditions have become a topic of a heated scientific debate due to the devastating consequences that they may have on natural and human systems. Tipping points are generally believed to be associated with a system bifurcation at some critical level of external conditions. When changing external conditions across a critical level, the system undergoes an abrupt transition to an alternative, and often less desirable, state. The main message of this paper is that the rate of change in external conditions is arguably of even greater relevance in the human-dominated Anthropocene but is rarely examined as a potential sole mechanism for tipping points. Thus, we address the related phenomenon of rate-induced tipping: an instability that occurs when external conditions vary faster, or sometimes slower, than some critical rate, usually without crossing any critical levels (bifurcations). First, we explain when to expect rate-induced tipping. Then, we use three illustrative and distinctive examples of differing complexity to highlight the universal and generic properties of rate-induced tipping in a range of natural and human systems.},

  abstract = {In systems ranging from lakes and woodlands to coral reefs, the long-term ecosystem state may often be determined largely by rare extreme events such as wet ENSO years, droughts, or disease outbreaks. Such events can flip these systems into a contrasting state that represents either an alternative attractor or a transient that is slow enough to persist even if the frequency of events that push the system to this state is low. Here we show that escape from herbivores is a mechanism that can play a role in several state shifts of this kind. This can happen if plants become less susceptible to herbivory as they grow. Using a model we show that, surprisingly, this mechanism can lead to a situation where a brief resource pulse for plants may invoke a persistent shift to a high biomass state whereas gradual enrichment to the same resource level is insufficient to allow such a change. This counterintuitive phenomenon occurs if the numerical response of herbivores is sufficiently slow to allow the plants to use the resource pulse to escape to a safe biomass at which herbivory is reduced. Our results imply that rates of environmental change can sometimes be more important than their magnitude. This has many ramifications. On the conceptual side, our findings suggest that key mechanisms that regulate long-term ecosystem dynamics are easily missed by the traditional focus of modelers on equilibria. A more practical corollary is that increased climatic variability may have more profound effects in some ecosystems than gradual change in conditions.},

Examples include the COVID-19 pandemic, which brought unprecedented health challenges and economic disruptions, and the emergence of geopolitical tensions and conflicts that have further strained international relations and economic stability. While empirical evidence on the dynamics and drivers of past societal collapse is mounting, a process-based understanding of these dynamics is still in its infancy. Here, we aim to identify and illustrate the underlying drivers of such societal instability or even collapse. The inspiration for this work is Joseph Tainter's theory of the ``collapse of complex societies'', which postulates that the complexity of societies increases as they solve problems, leading to diminishing returns on complexity investments and ultimately to collapse. In this work, we abstract this theory into a low-dimensional and stylized model of two classes of networked agents, hereafter referred to as ``laborers'' and ``administrators''. We numerically model the dynamics of societal complexity, measured as the fraction of ``administrators'', which was assumed to affect the productivity of connected energy-producing ``laborers''. We show that collapse becomes increasingly likely as the complexity of the model society continuously increases in response to external stresses that emulate Tainter's abstract notion of problems that societies must solve. We also provide an analytical approximation of the system's dominant dynamics, which matches well with the numerical experiments, and use it to study the influence on network link density, social mobility and productivity. Our work advances the understanding of social-ecological collapse and illustrates its potentially direct link to an ever-increasing societal complexity in response to external shocks or stresses via a self-reinforcing feedback.},

  abstract = {Critical transitions or regime shifts are sudden and unexpected changes in the state of an ecosystem, that are usually associated with dangerous levels of environmental change. However, recent studies show that critical transitions can also be triggered by dangerous rates of environmental change. In contrast to classical regime shifts, such rate-induced critical transitions do not involve any obvious loss of stability, or a bifurcation, and thus cannot be explained by the linear stability analysis. In this work, we demonstrate that the well-known Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey model can undergo a rate-induced critical transition in response to a continuous decline in the habitat quality, resulting in a collapse of the predator and prey populations. Rather surprisingly, the collapse occurs even if the environmental change is slower than the slowest process in the model. To explain this counterintuitive phenomenon, we combine methods from geometric singular perturbation theory with the concept of a moving equilibrium, and study critical rates of environmental change with dependence on the initial state and the system parameters. Moreover, for a fixed rate of environmental change, we determine the set of initial states that undergo a rate-induced population collapse. Our results suggest that ecosystems may be more sensitive to how fast environmental conditions change than previously assumed. In particular, unexpected critical transitions with dramatic ecological consequences can be triggered by environmental changes that (i) do not exceed any dangerous levels, and (ii) are slower than the natural timescales of the ecosystem. This poses an interesting research question whether regime shifts observed in the natural world are predominantly rate-induced or bifurcation-induced.},

  abstract = {The paper studies a novel excitability type where a large excitable response appears when a system's parameter is varied gradually, or ramped, above some critical rate. This occurs even though there is a (unique) stable quiescent state for any fixed setting of the ramped parameter. We give a necessary and a sufficient condition for the existence of a critical ramping rate in a general class of slow--fast systems with folded slow (critical) manifold. Additionally, we derive an analytical condition for the critical rate by relating the excitability threshold to a canard trajectory through a folded saddle singularity. The general framework is used to explain a potential climate tipping point termed the `compost-bomb instability'---an explosive release of soil carbon from peatlands into the atmosphere occurs above some critical rate of global warming even though there is a unique asymptotically stable soil carbon equilibrium for any fixed atmospheric temperature.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Rate-induced tipping (R-tipping) occurs when time-variation of input parameters of a dynamical system interacts with system timescales to give genuine nonautonomous instabilities. Such instabilities appear as the input varies at some               critical rates               and cannot, in general, be understood in terms of autonomous bifurcations in the frozen system with a fixed-in-time input. This paper develops an accessible mathematical framework for R-tipping in multidimensional nonautonomous dynamical systems with an autonomous future limit. We focus on R-tipping via loss of tracking of base attractors that are equilibria in the frozen system, due to crossing what we call               regular R-tipping thresholds               . These thresholds are anchored at infinity by               regular R-tipping edge states               : compact normally hyperbolic invariant sets of the autonomous future limit system that have one unstable direction, orientable stable manifold, and lie on a basin boundary. We define R-tipping and critical rates for the nonautonomous system in terms of special solutions that limit to a compact invariant set of the autonomous future limit system that is not an attractor. We focus on the case when the limit set is a regular edge state, introduce the concept of               edge tails               , and rigorously classify R-tipping into reversible, irreversible, and degenerate cases. The central idea is to use the autonomous dynamics of the future limit system to analyse R-tipping in the nonautonomous system. We compactify the original nonautonomous system to include the limiting autonomous dynamics. Considering regular R-tipping edge states that are equilibria allows us to prove two results. First, we give sufficient conditions for the occurrence of R-tipping in terms of easily testable properties of the frozen system and input variation. Second, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the occurrence of reversible and irreversible R-tipping in terms of computationally verifiable (heteroclinic) connections to regular R-tipping edge states in the autonomous compactified system.},

  abstract = {This paper uncovers patterns of knowledge dissemination among scientific disciplines. Although the transfer of knowledge is largely unobservable, citations from one discipline to another have been proven to be an effective proxy to study disciplinary knowledge flow. This study constructs a knowledge-flow network in which a node represents a Journal Citation Reports subject category and a link denotes the citations from one subject category to another. Using the concept of shortest path, several quantitative measurements are proposed and applied to a knowledge-flow network. Based on an examination of subject categories in Journal Citation Reports, this study indicates that social science domains tend to be more self-contained, so it is more difficult for knowledge from other domains to flow into them; at the same time, knowledge from science domains, such as biomedicine-, chemistry-, and physics-related domains, can access and be accessed by other domains more easily. This study also shows that social science domains are more disunified than science domains, because three fifths of the knowledge paths from one social science domain to another require at least one science domain to serve as an intermediate. This work contributes to discussions on disciplinarity and interdisciplinarity by providing empirical analysis.},
