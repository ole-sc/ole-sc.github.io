I am a masters student at the Carl von Ossietzky University in Oldenburg studying Environmental Modelling.
Having a Bachelors degree in Mathematics from the University of Bonn, I am interested in mathematical methods for analysing real-world systems.

My mathematical interests are nonlinear dynamics, network science and statistics and all the related subjects.
Applications I am interested in are climate science, ecology, energy grids, neural dynamics in the brain, urban models and many more. 


### A Paper A Day
A current project of mine is to read a paper each day for a month to get some more knowledge of the fields I am interested in and be able to select a relevant topic for my master's thesis. 
You can find some more information about this project in the Blog Posts section.
