I am a masters student at the Carl von Ossietzky University in Oldenburg studying Environmental Modelling.
My interests are in mathematical methods for analysing real-world systems and the philosophy of modeling.

Mathematical topics I am interested in are nonlinear dynamics including autonomous and nonautonomous ODEs, network science and statistics.
Applied areas that I would like to explore are climate science, ecology, energy grids, neural dynamics in the brain, urban models and many more. 

A small selection of reports from my masters degree can be seen in the Portfolio section.

### A Paper A Day
Last year, I challenged myself to read a paper each day for a month to decide what topic I should do for my master thesis. My reading list and thoughts can be seen in the Blog Posts section.
