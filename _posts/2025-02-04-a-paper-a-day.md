A paper a day keeps the doctor away... Or was it an apple? Well I don't remember.

Anyhow, I currently have to choose a topic for my master's thesis and I feel like I could benefit from looking into different research areas to find out what field I want to move into. 
This is one of the reasons that I set myself a challenge: Read one paper every day for a month. 
By reading from a range of topics (of course related to my current interests), I hope to get an idea of different research fields and their open problems and whether I would be interested in pursuing a career in any of these fields.

To keep myself accountable, I set up this blog post, that I will update daily.
Unfortunately, I have some vacation planned, so the project has to paused for a couple of days. 
I want to start now anyways, because I need to decide on a topic relatively soon.

# Project Outline
- Start Date: 4th of February 2025
- Break Time (vacation): 12th - 23rd of February
- End Date: 18th of March
Total: 30 Days

**Paper selection:** First, some survey papers from different fields were selected. 
Additionally, some papers related to potential master's thesis topics were included.
Lastly, some papers that just sounded interesting or were written by some of my professors were selected as well.
In total, 15 papers were selected in order to leave room open for follow up research.
In the unlikely case that anyone reads this before I am finished, any paper suggestions are welcome as well (send me an email to ole.schuegl@uni-oldenburg.de).

**Topics:** I am interested in applying mathematical methods to real problems. Mathematically, I am interested in nonlinear dynamics, network science and statistics. The applications I am generally interested in are climate science, ecology, energy grids, neural dynamics in the brain, urban models and many more though my knowledge about some of these fields is pretty limited.
As you will see, most of the papers listed below will be related to the topics just mentioned.

**Workflow:** Every day, I will post a short summary of the paper and my thoughts on my personal interest in this subject. At the end, I will write a summary of what I learned and new perspectives I gained.
