A paper a day keeps the doctor away... Or was it an apple?

Anyhow, I currently have to choose a topic for my master's thesis and I feel like I could benefit from looking into different research areas to find out what field I want to move into. 
This is one of the reasons that I set myself a challenge: Read one paper every day for a month. 
By reading from a range of topics (of course related to my current interests), I hope to get an idea of different research fields and their open problems and whether I would be interested in pursuing a career in any of these fields.

To keep myself accountable, I set up this blog post, that I will update daily.
Unfortunately, I have some vacation planned, so the project has to paused for a couple of days. 
I want to start now anyways, because I need to decide on a topic relatively soon.

# Project Outline
- Start Date: 4th of February 2025
- Break Time (vacation): 12th - 23rd of February
- End Date: 18th of March
Total: 30 Days

**Paper selection:** First, some survey papers from different fields were selected. 
Additionally, some papers related to potential master's thesis topics were included.
Lastly, some papers that just sounded interesting or were written by some of my professors were selected as well.
In total, 15 papers were selected in order to leave room open for follow up research.
In the unlikely case that anyone reads this before I am finished, any paper suggestions are welcome as well (send me an email to ole.schuegl@uni-oldenburg.de).

**Topics:** I am interested in applying mathematical methods to real problems. Mathematically, I am interested in nonlinear dynamics, network science and statistics. The applications I am generally interested in are climate science, ecology, energy grids, neural dynamics in the brain, urban models and many more though my knowledge about some of these fields is pretty limited.
As you will see, most of the papers listed below will be related to the topics just mentioned.

**Workflow:** Every day, I will post a short summary of the paper and my thoughts on my personal interest in this subject. At the end, I will write a summary of what I learned and new perspectives I gained.

A list of all papers can be found at the bottom of the page.

# Summaries
## 1. Modeling Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos: A Review (2009)
**04.02.2025:** 
The paper describes various aspects of building nonlinear models from time series data. The authors shortly introduce early influential works. 
Then, model classes are described that have been used to model nonlinear dynamics like polynomials, neural networks, radial basis functions, wavelets and more.
Structure selection, or the question of choosing a model that is as simple as possible but sufficiently complex to capture the dynamics underlying the data, and embeddings as part of the modeling process are discussed.
Lastly, techniques for parameter estimation and model validation were described.

In summary, most aspects of model construction from time series data were discussed and examples of papers were provided. Though likely being out-of-date, it might serve as a really good reference work for finding previous work in this area. From here it would be interesting to see whether there are more recent papers along the lines of this one.
Though this direction of research is interesting to me, I am more interested in understanding a given ODE rather than finding an ODE that describes some given data well. 

## 2. 25 years of criticality in neuroscience — established results, open controversies, novel concepts (2019)
**05.02.2025:** In the paper the controveries behind the concept of criticality in the brain is discussed: Power law distibutions of avalanches, that is cascades of neural activity, were found in experiments suggesting neural activity is in a critical state. However, follow-up, in vivo experiments usually do not show power law distributions of avalanche sizes.
Criticality would leat to some positive and some negative effects to brain function. The authors argue that the best balance between these effects is likely achieved close to, but not exactly at criticality. 
Based on a previous publication by the authors where they introduced a method to quantify the distance to criticality, they argue that the brain is in a "reverberating regime" that has some upsides and can potentially resolve the controversities surrounding criticality.

Short and easy to read. Gives an interesting overview of the question of criticality and offers a potential solution. The topic is very fascinating and I could certainly see myself moving in this direction at some point. I will add another paper related to this topic, because I feel like a lot of aspects of computational neuroscience are not covered.
