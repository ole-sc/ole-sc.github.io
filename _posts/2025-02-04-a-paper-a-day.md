A paper a day keeps the doctor away... Or was it an apple? Well I don't remember.

Anyhow, I currently have to choose a topic for my master's thesis and I feel like I could benefit from looking into different research areas to find out what field I want to move into. 
This is one of the reasons that I set myself a challenge: Read one paper every day for a month. 
By reading from a range of topics (of course related to my current interests), I hope to get an idea of different researc fields and their open problems and whether I would be interested in pursuing a career in any of these fields.

To keep myself accountable, I set up this blog post, that I will update daily.
Unfortunately, I have some vacation planned, so the project has to paused for a couple of days. 
I want to start now anyways, because I need to decide on a topic relatively soon.

### Project Outline
- Start Date: 4th of February 2025
- Break Time: 12th of February - 23rd of February
- End Date: 18th of March
-> Total days: 30

**Paper selection:** First, some survey papers from different fields were selected. 
Additionally, some papers related to potential master's thesis topics were included.
Lastly, some papers that just sounded interesting or were written by some of my professors were selected as well.
In total, 15 papers were selected in order to leave room open for follow up research.
In the unlikely case that anyone reads this before I am finished, any paper suggestions are welcome as well.
