I will start a blog miniseries related to my master thesis. In this series, I want to write up early results and studies in an organized way so that I can use them as a template when writing the real thesis.

So far, I am planning to write one post on bifurcation analysis and one on non-autonomous ODEs. We will see if there are additional topics that come up.

## Bifurcation Analysis
We begin with classical bifurcation analysis of autonomous ODEs. I will not write this as a tutorial, but rather as a description of the analysis I am applying to the particular system I am studying.
The system is a three-species food chain model that exhibits chaos
